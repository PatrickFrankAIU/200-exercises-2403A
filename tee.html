    <!--Our Story-->
 <p>Here at Lunar, our concept began with a dream and became an incredible reality in October of 2000. 
    The dream of having a jewlry co. was of course, at the heart of our owners Cherly and Don Conway. 
They wanted to offer our customers quality jewlry at a reasonable price. For them, jewelry buying and design is so much more than
just an action. It is meant to be enjoyed. It is meant to be fun! </p>

<!--Our Mission-->

<p>At Lunar Sparkle Jewelry, we're dedicated to creating beautiful, sustainable jewelry that you can feel good about wearing.
    And be proud to wear, we create sophisticated and fashionable jewelry which combines elegant design with high quality.
